"""Render the paper, ticket stock and printed-cotton tiles as real images.

    python3 tools/build-textures.py

The piece used to lean on a single SVG fractal-noise overlay for its paper,
which is why it read as flat and vectorial: one frequency, no fibre, no
mottling, no colour life. These are built in the frequency domain instead --
a random field shaped by a 1/f falloff and inverse-transformed -- which gives
several things at once:

  * layered scales, so there is coarse mottling under fine grain rather than
    one uniform fizz;
  * fibre, by stretching the falloff along an axis so the noise smears into
    strands the way pulp actually lies;
  * seamless tiles for free, because an inverse FFT is periodic by
    construction, so no edge blending is needed.

Written out as small JPEGs: they are lossy, but the artefacts land inside noise
that is already random, and a tile costs tens of kilobytes instead of hundreds.
