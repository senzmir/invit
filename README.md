# Briotto Family Airline

The wedding invitation for **Filippo Briotto** and **Victoria Vanity Pamwenatse Akuunda**,
built as mail rather than a web page: a sealed airmail envelope you click open, with a letter
and three boarding passes sitting inside it. You pull out whichever you want — the passes can
be printed.

Three legs, one marriage:

| | Route | When | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `HOM → AMS` Amsterdam | 28 December 2026 | The vows — intimate ceremony, no reception |
| 2 | `AMS → WDH` Windhoek, Namibia | September 2027 | The traditional ceremony |
| 3 | `WDH → ITA` Italy | To be announced | The dinner |

Every leg flies **1D0**.

## Sending it

**Send a link, not a file.** A `.html` attachment has no app associated with it on most
phones — WhatsApp and mail apps download it and then dead-end. A link opens in any browser.

The invitation is published at an unguessable address:

    https://senzmir.github.io/invit/56e45cd6399d/#<the guest>

Nothing links to it, it carries `noindex,nofollow`, and `docs/robots.txt` tells every crawler
to stay away — so it is reachable only by someone you hand the address to (and by anyone they
forward it to; it is unfindable, not secret). The guest's name and note ride in the fragment,
the part after the `#`, which browsers **never send to the server** — so they exist only in the
link itself and in the reader's browser. GitHub sees a request for the page and nothing more.

### One-time setup

On GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch**, branch
`claude/wedding-invitation-airline-sjbjl4`, folder `/docs`. Save, wait a minute, and the address
above is live.

To move it to a different unguessable folder later, change `SITE` at the top of
[`assets/invitation.js`](assets/invitation.js) and run `node tools/build-site.js` — every link
minted after that points at the new one, and the old folder can be deleted.

## Minting an invitation

Open **`minter.html`** in any browser — double-click it, no server and no install needed. It is
one self-contained file, so it works anywhere, including a machine that has never seen this
repo. (`index.html` is the same desk but loads its scripts from `assets/`; work on that one and
run `node tools/build-minter.js` to rebuild `minter.html`.)

1. Type the guest's name. The three printed forms (full on the passes, first name in the
   letter, initial + surname on the stub) fill in automatically; overtype any of them if a
   name needs a hand.
2. Write a personal note, or leave it empty and the note block disappears.
3. Pick English or Italiano.
4. **Copy guest link** — that is what you send. **Send the link…** hands it to the OS share
   sheet on a phone; **Open the link** checks it yourself.

The file buttons underneath still work if you ever want a standalone copy — **Download**, or
**Share the file…** on a phone — but a file is the awkward way to send this to a guest. That single file is the whole
   invitation — fonts and artwork travel inside it, it makes no network requests, and it works
   as an email attachment on a plane. Roughly 170 KB.

If your browser blocks the download (Safari sometimes does from `file://`), use **Share**, **Open
in a new tab** and save from there, or **Copy the HTML** and paste it into a file yourself.

`minter.html` needs nothing beside it — no `assets/` folder, no network. If you ever see a banner
saying *“this is the development copy”*, you have opened `index.html` by mistake.

## Changing the wedding details

Everything factual lives in one place: the `LEGS` array at the top of
[`assets/invitation.js`](assets/invitation.js).

```js
{
  id: 'ams',
  from: 'HOM', to: 'AMS',
  seat: '1A', gate: '28', tkt: '2812-2026',
  time: '',   // e.g. '15:00'
  venue: ''   // e.g. 'Stadhuis, Amstel 1'
}
```

Leave `time` and `venue` empty and the pass prints *“full details to follow”*. Fill either in
and it prints instead — so when the Amsterdam venue is booked, one line here updates every
invitation minted from then on. Dates, city names and everything else visible are in `COPY`
just below, in both languages.

The invitation is deliberately plain JavaScript with no build step and no dependencies: open a
file, edit it, reload. The only generated file is `assets/fonts.js`.

## Notes on the invitation

- **The stamp carries the drawing of you two**, with the date on the band underneath. To swap
  the drawing for another one:

      python3 tools/prepare-stamp-art.py <the new picture>
      python3 tools/build-stamp-art.py

  The first crops off the design's own scalloped rim (the frame draws its own perforations, and
  two sets of teeth is one too many) and maps it onto the stamp's paper and ink so the artwork's
  ground and the stamp stock are the same colour with no seam. Delete
  `assets/stamp/couple.png` and rerun the second to fall back to the drawn posy, whose colours
  are the `BLOOM` block at the top of `assets/invitation.js`.
- **The envelope is the same design at every size.** Everything inside it — type, stamp,
  cancellation, wax seal — is sized off one `--w` custom property set to the envelope's own
  width, so a phone gets the same composition as a desktop, just smaller, rather than a
  re-laid-out one.
- **Two envelopes.** `ENVELOPE` at the top of [`assets/invitation.js`](assets/invitation.js) is
  `'quiet'`: plain ivory with a hairline plate rule, a drawn flap and a red wax seal with the
  monogram pressed into it. Set it to `'airmail'` for the striped par avion border and its
  little blue label instead. Everything else is identical.
- **Interaction is physical, not chrome.** There is no navigation bar. Click the envelope to
  break the seal: the flap turns over on its fold, then the letter rises out of the middle
  with the boarding passes lying across it at an angle, their corner sticking out. Pull out
  whichever you want by clicking the paper itself.
  Click the shrunken envelope at the top to put things back; `Esc` does the same, and the paper
  slides back in behind the envelope as it grows.
- **The letter arrives folded and opens on its crease.** The fold is real: two clipped copies of
  the letter, hinged along the middle, with the bottom half folded back behind the top one. It
  swings down, the shadow along the crease lifts, and then the scaffold is thrown away and the
  actual letter takes its place — so print, text selection and screen readers only ever see one
  letter.
- **The letter is two sheets of A4, not one long page.** A zero-width float whose top padding is
  a percentage of the sheet's own width holds each to the proportions of the paper it stands
  for; a long personal note can push the second one taller, as a real second sheet would be. The
  faint crease each sheet keeps sits across its own middle, where the fold that put it in the
  envelope actually fell — a single crease down the middle of one very long page is not a fold
  anybody has ever made. Below about 600px the type cannot shrink far enough to keep an A4
  page's worth of words on an A4 page and still be readable, so the first sheet runs longer than
  the paper and the crease is dropped rather than drawn through the middle of a paragraph.
- **It is meant to read as paper on a table, not as cards on a page.** Everything lies on a
  plain near-white surface inside a painted floral frame; light falls across each sheet, the cut
  edge catches it, and the far edge curves off. There is deliberately no pool of light over the surface: any such
  overlay is only ever as tall as the viewport, so down a long page it ends in a hard horizontal
  edge across the middle of the ground.
- **The papers are real textures**, rendered by
  [`tools/build-textures.py`](tools/build-textures.py) into `assets/textures.js`: writing stock
  for the letter and the envelope, thinner and whiter ticket stock for the passes. They are built
  in the frequency domain — a random field shaped by a 1/f falloff and inverse-transformed —
  which gives layered scales rather than one uniform fizz, fibre by stretching the falloff along
  an axis, and seamless tiles for free, since an inverse FFT is periodic. Rerun it to change
  them; the tiles are about 10–20 KB each.
- **The flowers are painted, not drawn**, by
  [`tools/build-flowers.py`](tools/build-flowers.py) into `assets/flowers.js`, and they frame the
  surface the mail lies on rather than the stationery: two paintings, each used twice, the second
  pair turned through half a turn so no corner repeats its neighbour. The frame is fixed to the
  viewport — the surface does not scroll, only the mail lying on it does — so a full-page
  screenshot shows it across the top and bare ground below, since a capture stitches together
  shots of a layer that only ever paints one screenful. On screen it is where it should be. Watercolour reads as watercolour because
  of what happens at the edge of a wash, so every petal gets a soft body, a rim of pigment
  settled just inside its boundary, a boundary pushed around by a noise field, and granulation
  over the whole thing; washes composite by multiplication, the way transparent paint layers do,
  and a petal painted over a stem first lifts the stem back toward white so it can cover it.
  Each painting is a JPEG on white shown with `mix-blend-mode: multiply` — white is where no
  pigment landed, so the surface keeps its own texture through them, at a fraction of what an
  alpha PNG of the same art would cost.
- **The odelela print is the Namibian half of the wedding.** It lines the envelope, so it is the
  first thing you see when the flap turns over, and runs as a band down the outside edge of every
  boarding pass. Its palette is not a matter of taste — fuchsia, scarlet, black and blush printed
  *on* white — so it is clustered straight out of the reference invitations rather than picked by
  eye. The tile is a half-drop repeat of concentric rosettes, drawn at three times scale and
  averaged down so the dye edges are soft, then pushed through a weave.
- **The passes are dealt out** of the envelope one after another, landing overlapped and each
  at its own angle, the way tickets fall. They have punched perforations and notched corners
  along the tear line. On paper they straighten up and separate again.
- **Print** gives you the three passes on A4 and nothing else — no envelope, no letter, no
  buttons, no grain.
- Works with JavaScript off (the letter and passes are simply laid out down the page), respects
  `prefers-reduced-motion` — which skips the fold and the deal entirely — and reads down to
  340px wide.
